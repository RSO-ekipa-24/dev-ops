SHARED-RESOURCES HELM CHART NOTES
=================================

Purpose:
--------
This chart deploys shared infrastructure for microservices, including:
- Ingress for routing external traffic
- GKE ManagedCertificate for TLS

Usage:
------
- When deploying a new microservice:
  - Add its subdomain to the ManagedCertificate and configure it in the GCP console (see main repo README for details)
  - Add a routing rule for the new subdomain in the Ingress template
- This chart is independent of individual microservices and should be deployed before them

Notes:
------
- Helm manages these resources; old standalone manifests should be removed after deployment
- Can be updated as new services or subdomains are added
